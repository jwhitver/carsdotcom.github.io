There is a new bar at Cars.com. Unlike the local Bar, this Bar does not serve any liquid refreshments. This bar is the **”Cars.com Device Bar”**, and in place of beer taps, it has the latest phone and tablet devices.

The Bar is one of the first steps that Cars is taking to create a broader mobile culture. While Cars.com was truly a mobile first-mover in the third party automotive space, we have historically compartmentalized any mobile work into mobile-specific teams. However, times have changed and mobile now makes up over HALF of our overall traffic! Clearly, we can't just "check the box" that we have a mobile presence. To succeed in this new omni-channel world, Cars.com has to consider mobile in every feature, product, and strategy. And it's not just people with "Mobile" in their title that need to think of Mobile, *it's all of us*.

The Device Bar at Cars.com is meant to facilitate a more mobile culture internally.  Just as most of us feel perfectly comfortable using any Internet browser, we need to know how to use mobile devices other than the ones that we own for personal use.  This means that even Apple "fan-boys" need to get familiar with Android, and those like me that think the size of an iPad Mini is just silly, still need to know how it feels to hold and use one.

In addition to providing the organization broader access to more mobile devices, the Device Bar was also designed to consciously solve pain points that the mobile teams have been battling when testing across devices. 

##### Devices were never charged, and never had a charger to go with them

> Devices on the bar and available for check-out are always plugged in and fully charged.

<p/>

##### Devices were getting lost or damaged

> Devices are locked to the bar via a cable so you can still use them naturally in your hand (vs. a kiosk).  User can also check out devices for use at their desks.

<p/>

##### Devices often could not download test apps or access development networks.
 
> All devices have iTunes and Google Play accounts for downloading apps, are linked up to our testing distribution software to install our test apps, and have access to the network.

<p/>

##### You had to individually check multiple devices to test the Mobile Website.

> The Device Bar uses "Ghost Lab", which automatically displays the same URL across all of the devices! You can even scroll on one device and see it scroll instantaneously on all of them.

### Evolving our Mobile Culture

Having access to these devices is just the first step to creating a mobile culture at Cars.com. We hope it inspires conversations about how each feature, button, or advertisement will appear and feel to our mobile users, no matter their device. The more we use mobile, the more it will become second nature to us, and the more Cars.com will become celebrated for its mobile friendliness.  Cars.com employees can now come to the bar and give it a try for testing or just get familiar with what the Mobile Applications Team is up to.
